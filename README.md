# HRDoc

This is the official PyTorch implementation of our paper: "HRDoc: Dataset and Baseline Method Toward Hierarchical Reconstruction of Document Structures" to be appeared in the AAAI-2023 conference.

We build HRDoc with line-level annotations and cross-page relations that support both NLP and CV research. HRDoc dataset aims to recover the semantic structure of the PDF document, which can be divided into three subtasks, includ- ing semantic unit classification, parent finding, and relation classification.

## Dataset Introduction

HRDoc contains 2,500 documents with more than 2 million semantic units. The following figure provides the statistics of semantic unit distribution over the train and test set of the HRDoc datasets.

# Release Issues

We have released scripts related to the data generation, rule-based system and including 4 parts: 
1. The scripts used to get colorized documents. See `utils/pdf_colorization.py`
2. PDF parser systems used to extract the text lines, equation, table, and figure areas. See `utils/extract_pdf_hrdh.py` and `utils/extract_pdf_hrdh.py`
3. The human-designed rule system as a new baseline. See `utils/relation_recover.py`
4. An end2end multi-modal system for reconstruction task. See `end2end_system` folder

The HRDS dataset and HRDH dataset have been released! Google drive([HRDS](https://drive.google.com/file/d/16a-_46htAcHs7zSRU_c1ohObd9BxGZ83/view), [HRDH](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1q7jHOuX3IF9lOC4aDSOlzEIet4q3NUN9/view)).

* We trained LayoutLMv2 on the HRDoc-Simple dataset with a batch size of 3 (page-level) for 30,000 steps, the training stage costs about 4.5 hours on single NVIDIA V100-24G GPU.
* `ResNet+RoIAlign (PubLayNet)` indicates the model pretrained on PubLayNet using FastRCNN with Resnet-50. The poor results may be casued by the gap between instance segmentation task and instance classification task.
* `DSPS Encoder (Rule-based dataset for training)` indicates the results when trained on the data from the PDF parser system and evaluated on the manually rechecked test set. Here for HRDS we delete all image/table elements in our rule-based dataset, and obtain their rough bounding boxes using Cascade-RCNN trained on about 1000 manually labeled document pages. (That's why the model achieves 0.0 F1-score in classifying Table/Figure categories) The detection configure file is posted on `end2end_system/detection`.
